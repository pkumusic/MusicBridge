* Transfers after RHO Overcalls 

** Principles 

- In order to solve the issue that new suit in 2lv after overcall is forcing, which shut down
the weak hand bid (e.g. 6-9 points with 6 card or 5 good card suit). It also comes with the great benefit
of right siding the declarer and make the overcaller the opening leader.
- Transfers only on when partner opens and RHO doubles or overcalls 1 or 2 levels naturally.
- 3 level calls are natural. e.g., weak jump shifts and natural 3 level calls are still there.
- Transfer to oppo's suit is GF (just a way of GF when no better bids, not the only way).  
- Double's meaning priority: 

1. transfer to a major when overcall D or H. 
2. show the other major when overcall S 
3. natrual negative double when it cannot be the above 2 meanings.

- 1S is transfering to NT or C. Opener always bid 1NT (not considering stopper since low level).
- 2S is transfering to NT or C. Opener bids 2NT with stopper, and 3C without stopper.

According to the above principles, we list the following bidding table.

** Interference over our 1C

1C-(DBL)  
    Rdbl = 10+. Usually no 4 card major. Every DBL are penalty afterwards.
    1D   = 4+H, 6+ hcp
